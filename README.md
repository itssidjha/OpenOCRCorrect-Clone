# Creating Databse for Framework:

The folder “data/Book1Sanskrit” contains:-
1) A book named “Aryabhatiyabhashya of Nilakantha III Golapada (1957).pdf” for demo example.
2) “Dict” which is text file for Sanskrit Dictionary of 1.3 million words.
3) “IEROCR” text file that contains the OCR output of the book, each page separated by newline. ER represents English Removed, we ignore the words in english as Sanskrit ind-senz does not recognize English. Instead of ind-senz, output any OCR system can be used with the same filename.
4) “GEROCR” text file that contains the Google Doc output of the book, each page separated by newline. Instead of ind-senz, output any OCR system, other than one used in step 3 (above), can be used with the same filename.
5) SRules that contain 71 Sandhi Splitting Rules.
6) A text file with name "PWords" may be additionally added in folder "Book1Sanskrit" with Domain words, each separated by a newline, if known in advance.
7) A text file with name "CPair" may be additionally added in folder "Book1Sanskrit" with tab separated Correction pairs, one pair in one line, if known in advance. Prior OCR Confusions are also loaded from this file in additions to the autocorrections performed.
8) Folder “Inds” with jpeg files for first 20 pages of book and corresponding per page output from Indsenz.
9) Folder “Correct” with correct output of corresponding 20 pages in folder “Inds”.
10) Folder “Corrected” in which the output corrected by the user would be loaded while using the application.

4) Finally, after loading data, page1.txt will again appear in the text browzer. Left click on the word to change the mouse cursor position and then right click on the colored words to generate suggestions.
5) Type in slp1 format and press “Cntrl+d” to change the text under cursor to Devanagari.

If there are any issues in the format, just right click on the word and select the correct suggestion. Leave the correct colored words as it is.
